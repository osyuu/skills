Reference for `flutter-dart-code-review` — §1 project health, §2 Dart language pitfalls, §6 testing, §10 dependencies, §15 static analysis.

## 1. General Project Health

- [ ] Project follows consistent folder structure (feature-first or layer-first)
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns: UI, business logic, data layers
- [ ] No business logic in widgets; widgets are purely presentational
- [ ] `pubspec.yaml` is clean — no unused dependencies; version constraints follow §10
- [ ] `analysis_options.yaml` includes a strict lint set with strict analyzer settings enabled
- [ ] No `print()` statements in production code — use `dart:developer` `log()` or a logging package
- [ ] Generated files (`.g.dart`, `.freezed.dart`, `.gr.dart`) are up-to-date or in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Platform-specific code isolated behind abstractions

---

## 2. Dart Language Pitfalls

- [ ] **Implicit dynamic**: Missing type annotations leading to `dynamic` — enable `strict-casts`, `strict-inference`, `strict-raw-types`
- [ ] **Null safety misuse**: Excessive `!` (bang operator) instead of proper null checks or Dart 3 pattern matching (`if (value case var v?)`)
- [ ] **Type promotion failures**: Using `this.field` where local variable promotion would work
- [ ] **Catching too broadly**: `catch (e)` without `on` clause; always specify exception types
- [ ] **Catching `Error`**: `Error` subtypes indicate bugs and should not be caught
- [ ] **Unused `async`**: Functions marked `async` that never `await` — unnecessary overhead
- [ ] **`late` overuse**: `late` used where nullable or constructor initialization would be safer; defers errors to runtime
- [ ] **String concatenation in loops**: Use `StringBuffer` instead of `+` for iterative string building
- [ ] **Mutable state in `const` contexts**: Fields in `const` constructor classes should not be mutable
- [ ] **Ignoring `Future` return values**: Use `await` or explicitly call `unawaited()` to signal intent
- [ ] **`var` where `final` works**: Prefer `final` for locals and `const` for compile-time constants
- [ ] **Relative imports**: Use `package:` imports for consistency
- [ ] **Mutable collections exposed**: Public APIs should return unmodifiable views, not raw `List`/`Map`
- [ ] **Missing Dart 3 pattern matching**: Prefer switch expressions and `if-case` over verbose `is` checks and manual casting
- [ ] **Throwaway classes for multiple returns**: Use Dart 3 records `(String, int)` instead of single-use DTOs
- [ ] **`print()` in production code**: Use `dart:developer` `log()` or the project's logging package; `print()` has no log levels and cannot be filtered

## 6. Testing

### Test types and expectations:
- [ ] **Unit tests**: Cover all business logic (state managers, repositories, utility functions)
- [ ] **Widget tests**: Cover individual widget behavior, interactions, and visual output
- [ ] **Integration tests**: Cover critical user flows end-to-end
- [ ] **Golden tests**: Pixel-perfect comparisons for design-critical UI components

### Coverage targets:
- [ ] Aim for 80%+ line coverage on business logic
- [ ] All state transitions have corresponding tests (loading → success, loading → error, retry, etc.)
- [ ] Edge cases tested: empty states, error states, loading states, boundary values

### Test isolation:
- [ ] External dependencies (API clients, databases, services) are mocked or faked
- [ ] Each test file tests exactly one class/unit
- [ ] Tests verify behavior, not implementation details
- [ ] Stubs define only the behavior needed for each test (minimal stubbing)
- [ ] No shared mutable state between test cases

### Widget test quality:
- [ ] `pumpWidget` and `pump` used correctly for async operations
- [ ] `find.byType`, `find.text`, `find.byKey` used appropriately
- [ ] No flaky tests depending on timing — use `pumpAndSettle` or explicit `pump(Duration)`
- [ ] Tests run in CI and failures block merges

## 10. Package/Dependency Review

### Evaluating pub.dev packages:
- [ ] Check **pub points score** (aim for 130+/160)
- [ ] Check **likes** and **popularity** as community signals
- [ ] Verify the publisher is **verified** on pub.dev
- [ ] Check last publish date — stale packages (>1 year) are a risk
- [ ] Review open issues and response time from maintainers
- [ ] Check license compatibility with your project
- [ ] Verify platform support covers your targets

### Version constraints:
- [ ] Use caret syntax (`^1.2.3`) for dependencies — allows compatible updates
- [ ] Pin exact versions only when absolutely necessary
- [ ] Run `flutter pub outdated` regularly to track stale dependencies
- [ ] No dependency overrides in production `pubspec.yaml` — only for temporary fixes with a comment/issue link
- [ ] Minimize transitive dependency count — each dependency is an attack surface

### Monorepo-specific (melos/workspace):
- [ ] Internal packages import only from public API — no `package:other/src/internal.dart` (breaks Dart package encapsulation)
- [ ] Internal package dependencies use workspace resolution, not hardcoded `path: ../../` relative strings
- [ ] All sub-packages share or inherit root `analysis_options.yaml`

---

## 15. Static Analysis

### Configuration:
- [ ] `analysis_options.yaml` present with strict settings enabled
- [ ] Strict analyzer settings: `strict-casts: true`, `strict-inference: true`, `strict-raw-types: true`
- [ ] A comprehensive lint rule set is included (very_good_analysis, flutter_lints, or custom strict rules)
- [ ] All sub-packages in monorepos inherit or share the root analysis options

### Enforcement:
- [ ] No unresolved analyzer warnings in committed code
- [ ] Lint suppressions (`// ignore:`) are justified with comments explaining why
- [ ] `flutter analyze` runs in CI and failures block merges

### Key rules to verify regardless of lint package:
- [ ] `prefer_const_constructors` — performance in widget trees
- [ ] `avoid_print` — use proper logging
- [ ] `unawaited_futures` — prevent fire-and-forget async bugs
- [ ] `prefer_final_locals` — immutability at variable level
- [ ] `always_declare_return_types` — explicit contracts
- [ ] `avoid_catches_without_on_clauses` — specific error handling
- [ ] `always_use_package_imports` — consistent import style
